# Wanted Features for Knowledge Graph Tools

This document outlines additional features and tools that would enhance the functionality of the knowledge graph system.

## Query and Search Tools

1. **Entity Details Tool**
   - Retrieve comprehensive information about specific entities
   - Include all properties, labels, and relationships
   - Option to specify depth of relationship traversal
   - Support for multiple entity IDs in a single query

## Management Tools


## Validation and Schema Tools

5. **Schema Validation Tool**
   - Validate entity and relationship structures before creation
   - Check property types and required fields
   - Verify relationship constraints
   - Preview potential schema violations

6. **Schema Management Tool**
   - Define and modify property constraints
   - Create and update relationship types
   - Manage indexes and unique constraints
   - Version control for schema changes

## Analysis Tools

7. **Graph Analytics Tool**
   - Basic graph metrics (centrality, density, etc.)
   - Path finding between entities
   - Community detection
   - Pattern matching capabilities

8. **Visualization Tool**
   - Generate graph visualizations
   - Interactive exploration capabilities
   - Customizable layouts and styling
   - Export options for different formats

## Integration Features

9. **Batch Operations**
   - Bulk import/export functionality
   - Transaction management
   - Progress tracking for long-running operations
   - Error handling and rollback capabilities

10. **API Integration**
    - REST API endpoints for all operations
    - WebSocket support for real-time updates
    - Authentication and authorization
    - Rate limiting and quota management

## Implementation Priority

High Priority:
- Entity Search Tool
- Entity Details Tool
- Entity Update Tool
- Schema Validation Tool

Medium Priority:
- Entity Deletion Tool
- Batch Operations
